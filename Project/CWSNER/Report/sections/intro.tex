The goal of this subject is to learn the sequence labeling in the natural language processing field.

There are two classic and basic task in natural language processing, especially in Chinese, the word segmentation and named entity recognition.

In Chinese, we need word segmentation to seperate words, even the little difference of splitting point may possibly influence whole meaning of entire sentence.

And extract named entities from an article or web page can helps us quickly summary the subject. Sometimes we can also find the relationship between named entities that helps us to form the connection between them.
